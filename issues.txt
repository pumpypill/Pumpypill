# Pumpy Pills Pre-Release Review

## 1. Input Responsiveness

- **Issue:**  
  There is a known input delay (see `BUGLOG.md`). The debounce time in `InputManager` is set to 100ms, which may still feel sluggish for a fast-paced game.  
  **Suggestion:**  
  Consider reducing `debounceTime` further (e.g., 50ms) or making it adaptive based on game state. Test on various devices for optimal feel.

## 2. Asset Loading Robustness

- **Observation:**  
  Character images are loaded with retry logic (up to 3 times). However, if any image fails after retries, the game will not proceed to the start screen.
- **Suggestion:**  
  Allow the game to start even if some images fail to load, using fallback colors. Optionally, display a warning for missing assets.

## 3. Error Handling

- **Strength:**  
  There is extensive try/catch error handling in the main game loop and draw routines.
- **Suggestion:**  
  Consider displaying a user-friendly error overlay if a critical error occurs, rather than only logging to the console.

## 4. Performance Monitoring

- **Observation:**  
  The `PerformanceMonitor` is robust and can be toggled with `debugMode`.  
  **Suggestion:**  
  Consider adding a keyboard shortcut (e.g., `D`) to toggle debug mode at runtime for easier diagnostics.

## 5. UI/UX

- **Strength:**  
  The UI is visually appealing and provides clear feedback for state transitions, character selection, and pattern changes.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Add a "How to Play" or "Help" button for new users.
  - Consider adding sound/mute controls.
  - Add a visible indicator for the currently selected character on the start/game over screens.

## 6. Game Balance & Difficulty

- **Observation:**  
  Difficulty progression is well-structured, but the jump physics and obstacle patterns may need tuning for fairness and fun.
- **Suggestion:**  
  Playtest for difficulty spikes, especially with the 'narrow' and 'zigzag' patterns. Consider making the first few levels easier.

## 7. Code Quality & Maintainability

- **Strength:**  
  The codebase is modular, with clear separation of concerns.
- **Suggestion:**  
  - Add more JSDoc comments for public methods.
  - Consider extracting magic numbers (e.g., color codes, font sizes) into constants for easier tweaking.
  - Add unit tests for core logic (e.g., collision detection, difficulty progression).

## 8. Accessibility

- **Observation:**  
  The game relies on color for feedback (e.g., pattern changes, character selection).
- **Suggestion:**  
  Add alternative cues (e.g., icons, text labels) for colorblind accessibility.

## 9. Mobile/Touch Support

- **Strength:**  
  Touch input is supported.
- **Suggestion:**  
  Test on various mobile devices for scaling, touch accuracy, and performance.

## 10. Miscellaneous

- **404 and index.html:**  
  Both redirect to the main game. This is good for user experience.
- **Server.js:**  
  Simple and effective for local testing.
